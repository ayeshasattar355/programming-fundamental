4.2 — Four different C++ statements that add 1 to integer x:

x = x + 1;
x += 1;
++x;
x++;

---
4.3 — C++ statements accomplishing each task:

a) In one statement assign the sum of current x and y to z and postincrement x:

z = x++ + y;
b) If count > 10, print:

if (count > 10)
    std::cout << "Count is greater than 10\n";

c) Predecrement x by 1, then subtract it from total:

total = total - --x;   // or total -= --x;

d) Remainder after q divided by divisor, assign to q (two ways):

q = q % divisor;
q %= divisor;

---

4.4 — Statements:

a)
unsigned int sum = 0;

b)
unsigned int x = 1;

c)
sum = sum + x;   // or sum += x;

d)

std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << '\n';


---

4.5 — Combine 4.4 into a while program that sums integers 1..10 (loop stops when x becomes 11):

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    unsigned int sum = 0;
    unsigned int x = 1;

    while (x <= 10) {   // loop terminates when x becomes 11
        sum += x;
        x++;
    }

    std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << '\n'; // should print 55
    return 0;
}


---

4.6 — Assume before each statement execution all variables start at value 5. State values after the statement:

a) product *= x++;

Evaluation: uses old x (5) in multiplication, then x is post-incremented to 6.

Result: product = 5 * 5 = 25, x = 6.

b) quotient /= ++x;

Evaluation: pre-increment x first (from 5 to 6), then integer division quotient = 5 / 6. For unsigned int integer division result is 0.

Result: quotient = 0, x = 6.

---

4.7 (a) Input unsigned int variable x with cin and >>:

std::cin >> x;

4.7 (b)

Input unsigned int variable y with cin and >>.

unsigned int y;
cin >> y;


---

4.7 (c)

Declare unsigned int variable i and initialize it to 1.

unsigned int i = 1;


---

4.7 (d)

Declare unsigned int variable power and initialize it to 1.

unsigned int power = 1;


---

4.7 (e)

Multiply variable power by x and assign the result to power.

power = power * x;
// or shorter: power *= x;


---

4.7 (f)

Pre-increment variable i by 1.

++i;


---

4.7 (g)

Determine whether i is less than or equal to y.

i <= y

(Used inside while condition.)


---

4.7 (h)

Output integer variable power with cout and <<.

cout << power;


---


●4.8 — Complete Program for x^y

•Using all statements of 4.7, this is the full solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    unsigned int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;

    unsigned int i = 1;
    unsigned int power = 1;

    while (i <= y) {
        power *= x;
        ++i;
    }

    cout << power;
    return 0;
}

● 4.9 — Identify and Correct Errors

(a)

■ Error: Missing variable declarations.
■Misplaced braces in book.

✔ Correct:

int c = 1;
int product = 1;

while (c <= 5) {
    product *= c;
    ++c;
}


---

(b)

● Wrong operator: cin << value;
cin uses >>

✔ Correct:

cin >> value;


---

(c)

■Error 1: gender = 1 uses assignment
■Error 2: else; ends the else statement
■ Error 3: Output of "Man" always prints.

✔ Correct:

if (gender == 1)
    cout << "Woman" << endl;
else
    cout << "Man" << endl;

■4.10 — What’s wrong with the while statement?

Given:

while (z >= 0)
    sum += z;

● Problem:

The loop will never stop because z is never changed.

✔ Correct:

while (z >= 0) {
    sum += z;
    --z;       // must change variable
}

》infinite loop
