4.2 — Four different C++ statements that add 1 to integer x:

x = x + 1;
x += 1;
++x;
x++;

---
4.3 — C++ statements accomplishing each task:

a) In one statement assign the sum of current x and y to z and postincrement x:

z = x++ + y;
b) If count > 10, print:

if (count > 10)
    std::cout << "Count is greater than 10\n";

c) Predecrement x by 1, then subtract it from total:

total = total - --x;   // or total -= --x;

d) Remainder after q divided by divisor, assign to q (two ways):

q = q % divisor;
q %= divisor;

---

4.4 — Statements:

a)
unsigned int sum = 0;

b)
unsigned int x = 1;

c)
sum = sum + x;   // or sum += x;

d)

std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << '\n';


---

4.5 — Combine 4.4 into a while program that sums integers 1..10 (loop stops when x becomes 11):

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    unsigned int sum = 0;
    unsigned int x = 1;

    while (x <= 10) {   // loop terminates when x becomes 11
        sum += x;
        x++;
    }

    std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << '\n'; // should print 55
    return 0;
}


---

4.6 — Assume before each statement execution all variables start at value 5. State values after the statement:

a) product *= x++;

Evaluation: uses old x (5) in multiplication, then x is post-incremented to 6.

Result: product = 5 * 5 = 25, x = 6.

b) quotient /= ++x;

Evaluation: pre-increment x first (from 5 to 6), then integer division quotient = 5 / 6. For unsigned int integer division result is 0.

Result: quotient = 0, x = 6.

4.7 (a) Input unsigned int variable x with cin and >>:

std::cin >> x;
